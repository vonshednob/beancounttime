beancounttime
=============

After installing through `pip`, like this

    $ pip install beancounttime

you can use this plugin in your time tracking files like this:

    ;; timetracking.beancount
    plugin "beancounttime.time"  "HR"

    1900-01-01 open Equity:Universe  HR
    1900-01-01 open Expenses:Work    HR
    1900-01-01 open Assets:Overtime  HR

    2000-01-01 * ""
      Expenses:Work:Hacking   4.50 HR
      Expenses:Work:Meeting   3.30 HR
      Equity:Universe        -8.20 HR

As you can see time is tracked in the form of `HH.MM`. The plugin will take
care of converting this format into the decimal form, so beancount can work
with it.

E.g. `3.30 HR` (3 hours, 30 minutes) will be converted to `3.50 HR`.

The plugin will only apply the conversion to transactions with the currency
that is passed as a parameter to the plugin (in the example `HR`).
